"introduction": { 
"paragraphOne" : "It is best to always add creativity to a seemingly boring yet lengthy rhetoric, monologue, rant, and composition. What if we report or write about the reportage, light documentary and voice over sessions of field reporters? Research (painstaking) is somehow the prevailing 	definiens of what I am about to do right now but then again what is boring if it is not even half as exciting (what). The fun, excitement, thrill and joy in discourses lie in the experimentation, exploration and attention to certain details. Corrine Catibayan is one of the youngest in the most recent batch of perfectly desperate journalists whom is hoping to get the most out of the infinite loop of apprenticeship programs of media entities in the Philippines. Is she going to get a shot at the top of the most vicious ladder of all or is she going to succumb to enormous amount of pressure like the rest of the onion skinned Generation Z." ,
"paragraphTwo" : "Right now I am a slave whom has been keeping tabs of Corrine Catibayan's ability to structure non-fictional stories  and check if she will fumble at every turn. If she succeeds in making me shut my trap forever and ever then well and good." ,

 "paragraphThree" : "The year is 2022 Anno Domini and the subject is Corrine Catibayan. Her body of work could somehow prove to her detractors (myself included) that she is worth it. Is she going to become a maverick or just another  product of the assembly line? Is she going to become a veritable trail blazer or a veritable failure of human society? I have listed some of her most recent expositions for reader's consumption. I ignored a lot her earlier reportage and there is no excuse for my shortcomings and missteps but fair is fair I am but a sleepy simpleton whom is trying to be objective and impartial every step of the way." } ,

Cavite Provincial Police ) mentioned off camera that it was a "Japanese"
old bridge as described by the residents. It was officially condemned by
the authorities as evidenced by their constant reminders to the juvenile
stowaways and bystanders that they are worried about their safety as the
stowaways are always converging on the condemned bridge.  They find it
inconvenient to lookout for the safety of the kids for a total of 24
hours a day, everyday. The tragedy occurred at around 9:00 pm yesterday
as the slumbering residents were disturbed by a very loud sound.
Thirteen of the residents converged in the area of Sitio Talisayan San
Palkor Dasmariñas Cavite, mostly minors. Most of them sat on the bridge
before the collapse of the same. Almost all of those inside the bridge
fell into the river after the collapse. Three of the alleged survivors
featured in the broadcast tried to recall their experiences after the
incident and their names are Jenny Rose, Danica Uy and Lester Neri (16).
They are 3 of the 5 survivors of the said incident. Most of them claimed
that they were "saved" by certain favorable conditions during their near
death experience. One of those who died was identified as John Michael
Beltran (17).  John was documented by the "department" to have been
escorted by his relatives to a Coroner nearby their area. Edgardo Alfon
claimed that the bridge immediately slid down into the stream which made
it difficult for the minors inside to find a way to save themselves, he
is by the way the uncle of one of the victims. The authorities created a
temporary dike to divert the flow of the stream going through the area
of the incident where the rescuers are doing their hazardous thing.
Tight security is being implemented as they have decided to cordon the
area to bar unauthorized personnel (excluding media, politicians) from
hampering the rescue efforts. Mayor Jennifer Arriaga inspected the area.
One of the victims remains to be a subject of the search and recovery
efforts. Rescuers are extending their search for atleast 24 hours to
hopefully increase the chance of finding the last apparent victim of the
non-living bridge.

"contentOfReportage": Preparations for the opening of the school year
2022 through 2023 are well underway. There are three modes available for
parents or guardians of new enrollee. The in-person, clear net , and
drop box modes were said to be put in place due to CONrona cosplay
event. They are encouraging guardians to use the clear net (online)
mode. According to the security guards (very credible source) only those
parent or guardian whom are obligated to pass certain school
requirements for the enrollment of their precious progeny are said to be
appearing through the in-person mode while all others are somehow smart
enough to avoid the inconvenience of facing "important" school
personnel. It appears as if they are reserving it for later. The School
Brigade (Brigada Eskwela) is back in action. This is the information
dissemination drive of the schools under the public sector bureaucracy.
It is also the preparatory ceremony to keep the spirit of parent,
teacher, student, and bureaucracy alive in the hearts and minds of the
all the stakeholders in the assembly line. It is suppose to start on
August 1, 2022 through August 26, 2022 as the country is finally gearing
for something exciting (boring) such as the opening and reopening of the
assembly line of new and recycled "drones" . The Oplan Comeback (Oplan
Balik Eskwela) is the duplication of the School Brigade but the emphasis
is more on their simple version of debriefing, orienting  and
reorienting the students in the matter of seeing more flesh, blood and
bones in real life. They are the students whom were programmed  to get
use to the distance learning program as it is the only mode of learning
during the CONrona cosplay event which lasted for almost three years.
Oplan Comeback is on August 15. Enrollment is up to August 22 which is
coincidentally the first day of the new school year. By November 2, 2022
(All Soul's Day) the full implementation of face to face classes is
expected to finally come to fruition.

Parañaque City.

"didSheFumble" : false,

"contentOfReportage": There is something in the air near the vicinity of
the so called Baclaran Church. The air of excitement emanating from the
solemnized existence of the first "Wednesday",of the month of August is
overpowering the senses of regular disciples of this church. It is a
couple of minutes past Three of the clock in the morning. Amidst the
restrictions and hanging fear at the back of their heads, people are
slowly converging inside the famous church of Our Lady of Perpetual
Help. For a certain respondent who goes by the name Narciso he does not
mind if a major portion of his life is spent inside the church for he is
recharging his proverbial batteries through prayer, sacrifice, charity,
mercy, meditation, faith and host of other intangible source of divine
grace to allow him to get through the daily grind of stressful workdays.
He confessed that he is asking for assistance from higher power to allow
him to financially contribute to the Curriculum Vitae crafting,
structuring and  upgrading of his progenies as they try to finish their
down the line moments in "school." Business activities on the other hand
including that of Garland, Street food, and Rosary vendors are relying
heavily on the divine oriented excitement as the disciples are coming in
minute drizzle so to speak. Jocelyn Agbayani candidly said that she came
rushing (in) at the eleventh hour into the church proper to assist
(listed as Catholic obligation) in the very first mass of the very first
"Wednesday",of the month. Yoli Posay whom is one of the featured
respondent, manifested on camera that she is fearful of the unseen
elements. She stressed her huge disbelief in the behavior of her fellow
lax devotees as she assume that health etiquettes are being ignored
deliberately by a huge majority of the caught unawares. They
(respondent/devotee) came from all walks of life so to speak but they
are unanimous including that of Efren Grimaldo when it comes to their
partiality to their not so hidden list of divine petitions. They are
asking that the WHO declaration will be completely reversed with regards
to some weird infection, hive mentality (forcing kumbaya) will prevail,
condition of their bodily system will go unscathed, and their nearly
dead means of livelihood will be spared from the dreadfully anticipated
perpetual disruptions of "non-essential" activities in the near future.
At the time of reporting the second scheduled mass for that specific day
has just started.

"didSheFumble" : false,

"contentOfReportage": After years of reluctance to reboot the classroom
style of teaching and learning, the switch is finally turned on again to
stimulate the atrophied senses of public school students as they
transition from one cosplay event to another which is now dubbed as the
comeback (to school) cosplay event. Costume role playing school
uniforms, bags and black leather shoes are the graphically classic items
at the Divisoria Plea Market District. Corrine's grocery cart checklist
is a note full of the current price range for these blandly designed
cosplay items. She checked a total of three items. Check. Check. Check.
The broad items under the uniform category namely Polo, Blouse, Long
Pants, and Skirts is priced above the 199 pesos level. Small sized
version of the items is about 200 pesos (less than 4 US Dollars) .
Medium sized version of the uniform is priced at 220 pesos(4 US
Dollars). Large sized version of the same is marked at about 240 pesos
(4 US Dollars). The extra large edition on the other hand is pegged at
around 260 pesos (4 US Dollars). Next on this regular list is the black
leather shoes. The small ones (size 24 through 29) are worth 150 pesos
(less than 3 US Dollars). Medium sized (size 30 through 35) shoes are
worth 180 pesos ( less than 3 US Dollars). Large (size 36 through 40)
shoes are worth 180 through 230 pesos while the Extra large (size 41
through 45) ones are worth 250 pesos. The heeled shoes are worth 200
pesos. The school type bags (last but not the least) on the other hand
are worth 150 through 250 pesos. Jerielyn Tamayo timidly confessed that
she adjusted her markup based on the present price of her inventory.
Eileen Gunong exclaimed that buying enthusiasm is still low although she
noticed a spike in purchasing moments during the weekend and Sunday's
which is a boon for stockists. The best quality school uniforms is
somewhat forever present at Divisoria so always haggle for your bang for
a buck chance of a lifetime.
