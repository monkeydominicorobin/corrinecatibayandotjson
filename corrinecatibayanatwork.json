"introduction": { 
"paragraphOne" : "It is best to always add creativity to a seemingly boring yet lengthy rhetoric, monologue, rant, and composition. What if we report or write about the reportage, light documentary and voice over sessions of field reporters? Research (painstaking) is somehow the prevailing 	definiens of what I am about to do right now but then again what is boring if it is not even half as exciting (what). The fun, excitement, thrill and joy in discourses lie in the experimentation, exploration and attention to certain details. Corrine Catibayan is one of the youngest in the most recent batch of perfectly desperate journalists whom is hoping to get the most out of the infinite loop of apprenticeship programs of media entities in the Philippines. Is she going to get a shot at the top of the most vicious ladder of all or is she going to succumb to enormous amount of pressure like the rest of the onion skinned Generation Z." ,
"paragraphTwo" : "Right now I am a slave whom has been keeping tabs of Corrine Catibayan's ability to structure non-fictional stories  and check if she will fumble at every turn. If she succeeds in making me shut my trap forever and ever then well and good." ,

 "paragraphThree" : "The year is 2022 Anno Domini and the subject is Corrine Catibayan. Her body of work could somehow prove to her detractors (myself included) that she is worth it. Is she going to become a maverick or just another  product of the assembly line? Is she going to become a veritable trail blazer or a veritable failure of human society? I have listed some of her most recent expositions for reader's consumption. I ignored a lot her earlier reportage and there is no excuse for my shortcomings and missteps but fair is fair I am but a sleepy simpleton whom is trying to be objective and impartial every step of the way." } ,
